          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi, this is Dennis Lubrin here!</p>
          <p>So, this page is supposed to give you, the reader, more information about who I am right? Well then, here goes...</p>
          <p>I currently work as an IT Administrator, a RIS/PACS Administrator, unofficial HIPAA officer, and Web Developer/Website Manager for a radiology facility in New Jersey.</p>
          <p>Ever since Middle School, maybe even before, I got interested in technology, specifically robotics... yeah... that didn't last very long.</p>
          <p>But, that was the reason why I decided to go to a "special" High School called <strong>Middlesex County Academy for Mathematics, Science, and Engineering Technologies</strong>. Yes, it's a long name. I just call it <strong>The Academy</strong>.</p>
          <p>Well, that was where I decided I don't like robotics, but I do like programming. So what do I take as my College major? Computer Science of course!</p>
          <p>I went to Middlesex County College and got my A.A.S. degree in Computer Information Systems (ie. Programming). Unfortunately, they focused on programming using JAVA. The Web Development course, which I really, really, REALLY wanted to take, never happened. Why? Because either there's no professor, or there's not enough people who want to take it.</p>
          <p>So, what do I do? Well, I take online courses to learn on my own. Courses, like the <a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-html" target="_blank">One Month HTML</a> course!</p>
          <p>If you guys want to learn how to code, join the <a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-html" target="_blank">One Month HTML</a> course and you can learn how to create your own website in just ONE MONTH!</p>
